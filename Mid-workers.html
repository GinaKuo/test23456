            Job Description: Crafting/ Designing/ Ideation.
        <p class="sky_introduction">I originally wanted to start my own business. It's not about getting rich; I've always believed that happiness matters more than money.I wanted to create happiness with my own hands. Plus, it's a way for me to honor my beloved late grandfather. He may not be with us anymore, but his woodworking skills live on through our family. Woodworking is my tribute to him, and it makes me feel like he's still with us.</p>
